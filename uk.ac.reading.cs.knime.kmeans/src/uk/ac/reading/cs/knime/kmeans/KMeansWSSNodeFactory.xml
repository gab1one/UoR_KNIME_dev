    <shortDescription>
        Implementation of the k-Means clustering algorithm returning the validity measure WSS and BSS.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			This node outputs the cluster centers for a predefined number of
			clusters (no dynamic number of clusters).
			K-means performs a crisp clustering that assigns a data
			vector to exactly one cluster. The algorithm terminates when the
			cluster assignments do not change anymore.<br />
			The clustering algorithm uses the Euclidean distance on the selected
			attributes. The data is not normalized by the node (if required,
			you should consider to use the "Normalizer" as a preprocessing step).<br/>  
			If the optional PMML inport is connected and contains 
            preprocessing operations in the TransformationDictionary those are 
            added to the learned model.
			The node can be configured as follows:
		</intro>
		<option name="number of clusters">
			The number of clusters (cluster centers) to be created.
	    </option>
		<option name="max number of iterations">
		    The number of iterations after which the algorithm terminates,
			independent of the accuracy improvement of the cluster centers.
		</option>
